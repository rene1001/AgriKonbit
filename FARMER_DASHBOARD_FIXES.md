**Status:** ✅ All issues resolved and verified

---

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Transactions Table** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem:** The `farmer.js` route queries a `transactions` table (lines 368-380) that didn't exist
- **Solution:** Created complete `transactions` table with all required columns
- **Verification:** ✅ Table exists and queries work

### 2. **Missing Notifications Columns** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem:** The `farmer.js` route tries to insert `reference_type` and `reference_id` (lines 274-275) but columns didn't exist
- **Solution:** Added missing columns to `notifications` table
- **Verification:** ✅ Columns exist and queries work

### 3. **Missing Withdrawals Table** ❌ → ✅
- **Problem:** The withdrawal endpoint (lines 405-477) references a `withdrawals` table that didn't exist
- **Solution:** Created complete `withdrawals` table with all required columns
- **Verification:** ✅ Table exists and is ready for use

### 4. **User Wallets Query** ✅
- **Status:** Already correct - no fix needed
- **Note:** The query in `farmer.js` line 63-70 matches the schema perfectly

## 🔍 What Was Wrong Before

### Before Fix
```javascript
// This would fail because transactions table didn't exist
const transactions = await query(`
  SELECT * FROM transactions
  WHERE user_id = ?
  ...
`, [req.user.id]);
```

```javascript
// This would fail because reference_type/reference_id didn't exist
await query(`
  INSERT INTO notifications (user_id, type, title, message, reference_type, reference_id)
  VALUES (?, 'order_update', 'Commande mise à jour', ?, 'order', ?)
`, [user_id, message, order_id]);
```

### After Fix
✅ All queries work correctly with proper schema in place
